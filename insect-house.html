            <h3>INSECT HOUSE</h3>
              <p>nsect hotels are generally thought to be a positive force in restoring or maintaining wild pollinator populations, especially native bees, many of which are endangered due to various factors such as competition with introduced bees like the western honey bee. Insect hotels are especially thought to be a valuable resource for insects that have had their primary natural habitat destroyed. An example is Anthidium palliventre, which were common in the sand dunes of the San Francisco area â€“ the species has struggled as the dunes have mostly been paved over for urban development. Such insects are often forced to find alternative housing, such as in city parks, typically with less success. Over half of North America's native wild bees face similar difficulties, and the actual number is possibly greater due to insufficient data on certain species. Bee hotels are sometimes constructed, whether by private actors, such as well-meaning homeowners and gardeners, or by government-led conservation projects, in attempts to remedy this issue and provide habitat to stabilize struggling native bee populations</p>
